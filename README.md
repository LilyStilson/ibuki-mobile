## What is the difference?
Unlike all the Booru applications out there where developer decided beforehand which Boorus are available to user, **Ibuki** is highly customizable. You can yourself add whatever Booru out there to the **Ibuki** and it will display pictures from that Booru and retain full functionality (as long that Booru has a public REST API, of course). The application consumes a script file that has only one purpose - connect to the Booru API and return objects so even you with a bit of time can grab a Booru from *booru.org* and create a wrapper script for its API.

## Contribution
You are free to make any pull requests and code changes you want (as long it's within the licence), but keep in mind, that I'm working solo on this project in my spare time, so it would take a lot of time for me to review all the pull requests out there.
